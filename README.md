# Database-Systems

During the Fall of 2023, I worked on a project focused on creating and accessing relational database systems using methods other than SQL. The objective was to use external clients like the psycopg python library and object-relational mapping using the peewee python library to update a database. Both these Python libraries are great ways to access a database without using SQL commands. From this experience, I gained valuable expertise in different problem-solving approaches to using databases. Additionally, I gained knowledge of two new
Python libraries that are important for backed development in software engineering.

Technologies Used:
Programming Languages: Python, Psycopg library, Peewee library, PostgreSQL

Tools: Visual Studio Code, PgAdmin
